# }hexdump{ Foundation Historical Archive Decoder

## Overview

The }hexdump{ Foundation Historian is pleased to offer this
application allowing authorized Foundation associates to decode
documents from the Foundation's historical archive.  These documents
are significant to the development and implementation of the
Foundation's mission and we feel broader access will provide better
appreciation for the Foundation's vitally important work.

All archived documents are encrypted and the appropriate decryption
key is required to decode each document.

## Requirements

* Python 2.6 or 2.7

## Usage

Invoke the decoder as follows:

> ./bin/decoder [document URL] [decryption key]

The application will prompt for the document URL and decryption key if
neither is specified.

## Acknowledgments

This application bundles the mpmath multiprecision floating-point
arithmetic library, available from https://code.google.com/p/mpmath/ .

The Foundation Historian gratefully acknowledges the many individuals
who contributed to the development and testing of this application.
